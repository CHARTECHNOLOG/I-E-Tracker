**Company Expenses Tracker - Project Outline**

This project focuses on developing a web application to track and manage a company's expenses. The goal is to provide a platform where company administrators and team leads can log, analyze, and report expenses, providing insights into financial management. We'll also implement data analysis and visualization features for easy tracking of expenses over time.
